So here I am, writing a reason as to why I chose to learn Software Engineer. I mean, I can easily state that its my passion and its my dream come true, but that is not really true.

I suppose it starts with my current career status. I work for a multibillion dollar company as a graphic designer. For the past 5 years I have sharpened my skills as a designer, got certified as a SharePoint administrator and  became an employee that was essential for the business. While I do enjoy designing and feel valued I have lost something while working in the industry and that is the drive.

If I was to compare my current job and career path to a car ride, I will say that my job is like cruising on a nice easy road with a great set of wheels while over looking the sunset. Its too easy and overall, I know where I am going and how long its going to take for me to get there(which is a long while). 

I enjoy challenges and problem solving. I enjoy the occasional stress because it drives me to **be better**. And this is the drive that I am missing. I am too comfortable where I am at and to be honest, I don't see myself being a graphic designer my whole life.

I have been using code language ever since I was in middle school. When MySpace was a huge deal. I remember seeing the custom profiles and how impressed I was for seeing people's creation. I wanted to learn how the coding worked and so, I googled it. From there I learned HTML and CSS coding. It was pretty great. Those are the only two codes I have learned, which college also touched base with... that and Flash... y'all remember flash, right?...

**Anyways**, coding is also fundamental in the work I do now, from sending emails to our members as well as using JavaScript in SharePoint. While googling and youtubing helps me with work related projects, I want to be able to learn and understand the language I implement. I want to change the way I think about coding. I want to change my whole career and pursue a career that will give me my drive back, which I believe coding and this program will do just that.

Anyways, that's my reason. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Truly appreciate it :)
